# AiVa - Where Ai Meets HumanCare

## Background of Invention


Medication non-adherence has become a major global healthcare challenge, particularly among elderly individuals and patients living with chronic illnesses. Many patients struggle to follow prescribed medication schedules due to forgetfulness, physical limitations, or lack of continuous supervision. As a result, missed or incorrect dosages often lead to health complications and increased medical costs.

Traditional solutions such as manual pill boxes and basic reminder alarms provide limited support and are highly dependent on user memory and caregiver involvement. Although digital pill dispensers have introduced improvements in adherence, many existing systems still require partial manual operation and lack complete automation. In several cases, these systems depend heavily on mobile applications, which may not be convenient or accessible for all users, especially elderly patients.

Some automated systems use cartridge-based dispensing mechanisms; however, these designs are often complex and difficult for patients to handle independently. Additionally, many current solutions focus only on medication dispensing and do not include supporting features such as water delivery or emergency assistance, which are essential for patient safety and comfort.

The AIVa system is designed to address these limitations by offering a fully automated and integrated healthcare assistance solution. The system ensures accurate and timely dispensing of prescribed medication while minimizing the need for manual intervention. It incorporates user identification, intelligent reminders with multi-language support, integrated water dispensing, and an SOS emergency mechanism for critical situations.


By combining automation, safety features, and ease of use, AIVa enhances medication adherence, improves patient independence, and reduces the burden on caregivers and healthcare professionals. This holistic approach makes the system more reliable, accessible, and suitable for real-world healthcare environments.
