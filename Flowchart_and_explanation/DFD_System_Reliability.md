Data Synchronization and System Reliability

In addition to navigation and medicine delivery, the AIVa system ensures continuous data synchronization between its internal components and connected interfaces. Sensor readings, navigation status, and medicine dispensing updates are processed in real time to maintain system accuracy. This synchronization helps prevent data mismatch, supports reliable decision-making, and ensures that the system responds correctly to patient requests, even in dynamic or obstacle-rich environments.
