# AiVa - Where AI Meets HumanCare

## Explanation of Flowchart 1
AIVa - Is a technology where the artificial intelligence is used for human care.
It is a type of assistance system in which the it will move according to the location of the patient using LCR (Left,Center and Right) sensors and will dispense the required medicine. The direction of the signal will be given on a wristband which is connected by an alarm or alert system which gets triggered when the system starts and it will send signal to the robot. 

When the robot receives or reads the signal using its left,center and right sensors, based on that direction it will decide to go in which particular direction.It's main goal is to reach to the patient in minimal time, with more accuracy,to clear all the obstacles in between the path and to provide the required medicine to the patient. 

Problem Statement-:
Medication is extremely important for individuals who suffer from chronic diseases , espicially elderly patients. Many solutions exist nowadays for example manually implemented pill boxes, reminder alarms , checklists apps that are only limited in their efficiency and they can have many human errors. These solutions still lack a lot of innovation, intervention and seamless integration. 

The existing solutions-:
1) Lack full automation, seamless integration with healthcare systems,and comprehensive features for user convenience. 
2) They do not automate the entire dispensingg process.
3) Do not include integrated features like water dispensing or emergency support mechanisms.

Our Solution AiVa-:
It acts as an intelligent assistant robot that:

1) Receives direction signals from a wristband that will be worn by the patient. 
2) It will move in the direction provided by those signals-left,center or right.
3) Will reach the patient in minimal time and by avoiding obstacles.
4) Will dispense the required medicine safely.
