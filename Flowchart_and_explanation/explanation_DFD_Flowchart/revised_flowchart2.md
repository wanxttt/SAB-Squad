AiVa - Where AI Meets HumanCare-:

Explantion of FlowChart 2:

Flowchart 2 explains what happens after the AIVa robot successfully delivers medicine to the patient. Once the robot reaches the patient, it dispenses the prescribed medicine. After the patient takes the medicine, the system automatically updates the remaining stock and keeps the device and mobile application in sync.

AIVa continuously keeps track of how much medicine is being used. When the system detects that the remaining stock is enough for less than three days, it sends a notification to the mobile application. This alert informs the user or caregiver that the medicine is running low and should be reordered. The application also allows manual restocking, so the stock details can be updated easily after new medicine is added.

Why This Flowchart Is Important-:


This flowchart plays a key role in ensuring that patients never miss their medication due to stock shortages. By automatically tracking usage and sending timely alerts, the system reduces dependence on memory and manual checks. It helps caregivers stay informed, lowers the chances of human error, and ensures continuous and safe medication support, especially for elderly and dependent users.
