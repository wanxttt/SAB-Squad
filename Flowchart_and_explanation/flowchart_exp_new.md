Working of the Solution-:
When the robot receives or reads the signal using its left,center and right sensors, based on that direction it will decide to go in which particular direction.It's main goal is to reach to the patient in minimal time, with more accuracy,to clear all the obstacles in between the path and to provide the required medicine to the patient. 

It acts as an intelligent assistant robot that:
1) Receives direction signals from a wristband that will be worn by the patient. 
2) It will move in the direction provided by those signals-left,center or right.
3) Will reach the patient in minimal time and by avoiding obstacles.
4) Will dispense the required medicine safely.
