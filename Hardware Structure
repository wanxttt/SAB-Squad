 Because the Motor Shield sits on top of the Arduino, it uses up many digital pins. We need to be clever with the remaining pins for your sensors.
​Motors (M1, M2, M3, M4): Connected to the screw terminals on the Shield.
​Servo: Connect to the 3-pin header labeled SERVO_1 (usually connected to Pin 10) on the shield.
​IR Sensors (Intensity): To detect "intensity," you likely have IR Photodiodes (which give analog values) rather than TSOP receivers (which are just on/off). We will use the Analog Pins (A0-A5) which are usually accessible on the shield.
​Ultrasonic Sensor: We will use the remaining Analog pins as digital pins (A3 and A4).
​Pin Map:
​Left IR: Analog Pin A0
​Center IR: Analog Pin A1
​Right IR: Analog Pin A2
​Ultrasonic Trigger: Analog Pin A3
​Ultrasonic Echo: Analog Pin A4
​2. The Logic Flow
​Scan: The robot reads the 3 IR sensors.
​Compare: It checks which sensor has the highest value (Left, Center, or Right).
​Safety Check: The Ultrasonic sensor checks if the path ahead is clear.
​Action:
​If Center is brightest: Move Forward.
​If Left is brightest: Turn Left.
​If Right is brightest: Turn Right.
​If Obstacle Detected: Stop and reverse/turn (Safety override).
