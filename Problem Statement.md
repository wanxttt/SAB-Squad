## Problem Statement: The Crisis of Medication Non-Adherence

 The Core Challenge
Individuals suffering from chronic diseases, the elderly, and the physically disabled face a significant hurdle in maintaining their health: **medication consistency**. Relying on daily prescriptions is a necessity, yet the ability to manage these routines is often compromised by memory loss, age-related decline, or physical limitations.

 Key Pain Points
* **Memory & Aging:** For conditions like diabetes or heart disease, timing is critical. Memory loss in seniors often leads to missed doses, which can cause illnesses to worsen rapidly.
* **The "Double-Dosing" Risk:** A major danger is the confusion over whether a dose was already taken. This leads to patients either skipping a life-saving dose or accidentally overdosing by repeating it.
* **Mobility Barriers:** Physically disabled patients may be aware of the time but struggle to physically access their medication without a caregiver's assistance.
* **Caregiver Anxiety:** Family members cannot provide 24/7 supervision. This constant worry about a loved one's medication schedule creates high levels of stress for the entire household.

The Consequence
Regularly missing medication leads to a slow decline in health, increased hospitalizations, and preventable medical emergencies. There is an urgent need for a proactive system that does not just "remind" the user but ensures the medicine is physically delivered to them.

Our Solution
To bridge this gap, we have developed **AiVa – Where AI Meets Human Care**, a proactive robotic assistant designed to eliminate the risks of human error in medication management.
