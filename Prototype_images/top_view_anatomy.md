AiVa: Hardware Anatomy (Top View)
This top-down view showcases the core architecture of the AiVa prototype, balancing intelligent navigation with a practical delivery system.

1. The "Senses" (Left Side)
Ultrasonic Sensor (Eyes): The blue component with two silver circles at the front acts as the robot's eyes. It sends out sound waves to detect obstacles, ensuring the robot stops or maneuvers safely around furniture or people.

Navigation Controller: The complex wiring and circuit boards (Arduino/Motor Driver) serve as the "brain." It processes signals from the sensors to manage speed and direction.

2. The "Drive" (The Wheels)
Four-Wheel Drive System: The robot uses a sturdy 4-wheel setup with high-grip tires. This provides the stability needed to carry medication across different floor surfaces (tiles, carpets, etc.) without tipping over.

3. The "Payload" (The Cargo Box)
Medication Delivery Hub: The large cardboard compartment on the right is the heart of the solution. It is designed to hold multiple forms of medicine:

Bottle Storage: Large enough for standard prescription bottles or syrups.

Strip Placement: Dedicated space for blister packs/strips of pills.

Safety by Separation: The hardware (electronics) is physically separated from the medication area to prevent any heat or electrical interference with the medicine.
