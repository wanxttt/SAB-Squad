AiVa: A Closer Look (Diagonal View)
The diagonal perspective reveals the "ready-for-action" stance of the AiVa prototype, highlighting the height and accessibility of the medicine hub.

1. The Proactive "Face"
Low-Profile Sensing: Notice how the ultrasonic sensors (the silver "eyes") are mounted close to the base. This allows the robot to "see" small objects on the floor, like shoes or pets, ensuring it doesn't cause a trip hazard while moving toward the patient.

Compact Electronics: The Arduino and motor drivers are neatly tucked between the wheels and the cargo area, keeping the center of gravity low so the robot remains stable during turns.

2. The Practical Medicine Hub
Easy Access Height: The cargo box is built at a height that is easy for a seated elderly person to reach into. You can see how medicine bottles and syrups stand upright, preventing leaks and making them easy to identify at a glance.

Large Capacity: Unlike small pill dispensers, this "cargo-style" design allows for bulky items like cough syrup bottles or multiple boxes of supplements to be delivered in a single trip.

3. All-Terrain Stability
High-Clearance Chassis: The clear acrylic plates give the robot enough ground clearance to navigate over small door dividers or thick rugs, which are common in many homes.

Bold Visibility: The bright yellow wheels aren't just for movement; they make the robot highly visible to the patient, reducing the chance of accidental collisions.
