AiVa: The Friendly Face (Front View)
The front view of AiVa highlights its interactive and safety-first design. This is what the patient sees as the robot approaches them with their medication.

1. The "Sensory Shield"
Ultrasonic Vision: The most prominent feature is the HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor, which looks like a pair of silver eyes. These provide the robot with spatial awareness, ensuring it maintains a safe distance from the patient and never makes physical contact until it has safely stopped.

Tiered Chassis: The clear, curved acrylic plates at the base act as a physical buffer. This rounded design ensures that even if the robot is operating in a tight space, there are no sharp corners that could cause injury or catch on clothing.

2. The Integrated Brain (The Electronics)
Arduino Processing Power: Directly behind the sensors, you can see the blue Arduino microcontroller board. This is the heart of the robot, processing the distance data from the sensors and translating it into smooth motor movements.

Organized Connectivity: The colorful wires are carefully routed to ensure that the "eyes" (sensors) and "muscles" (motors) stay perfectly synced, providing a reliable and glitch-free experience for the user.

3. Service Readiness
Clear Visibility: From this angle, the medication box is visible in the background, showing that the robot is "carrying" its cargo safely and is ready to deliver.

Compact Footprint: The front profile shows how slim the robot is, allowing it to move through standard doorways and narrow hallways common in home environments.
