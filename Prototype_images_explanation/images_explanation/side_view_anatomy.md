AiVa: Profile & Stability (Side View)
The side profile of AiVa reveals the engineering balance between its mobile base and the utility of the medicine delivery system.

1. Robust Mobility Hub
Dual-Plate Chassis: You can see the two-tier acrylic base that provides a rigid structure for the robot. This design ensures that the weight of the medicine doesn't cause the robot to bend or lose alignment.

Balanced Wheelbase: The four large, yellow-rimmed wheels are positioned at the corners of the chassis. This wide wheelbase prevents the robot from tipping over, even when carrying heavier liquid medicine bottles.

2. Strategic Component Placement
Integrated Drive Train: From this angle, you can see the DC geared motors tucked neatly between the plates. This keeps the electrical "muscles" protected from dust and accidental bumps.

Brain Elevation: The Arduino board is mounted vertically or slightly elevated in the center. This placement is intentional—it keeps the delicate wiring away from the ground and provides easy access for maintenance.

3. Maximum Cargo Depth
Deep Storage Container: The side view highlights the depth of the cardboard delivery box. It is designed to be deep enough so that tall syrup bottles remain upright and secure during movement, even if the robot has to make a quick turn or stop.

Weight Distribution: The cargo is placed directly over the rear wheels, providing better traction and ensuring the front sensors have a clear, unobstructed "view" of the path ahead.
