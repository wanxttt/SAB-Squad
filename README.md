Key Features of AiVa
Smart Patient Localization: Instead of a fixed path, AiVa uses signal-strength triangulation to actively locate the patient within the home, ensuring it reaches them wherever they are resting.

Persistent & Adaptive Reminders: To prevent missed doses, AiVa uses a combination of audio and visual alerts. These intelligent reminders stay active until the patient acknowledges them, ensuring the medication is actually taken and not just delivered.

Safe & Hands-Free Delivery: AiVa physically transports medicine directly to the patient's side. This eliminates the need for elderly patients with mobility issues or tremors to walk to a cabinet, significantly reducing the risk of falls.

Next-Gen Caregiver Connectivity: Designed with the future in mind, AiVa is ready for mobile app integration. This will allow family members and doctors to monitor medication adherence in real-time from anywhere in the world.
