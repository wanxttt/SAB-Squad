# AiVi - Where AI Meets HumanCare

## Improvement for Round 2:-

We will make a full fleged mobile app which will be used for controlling and monitoring the medication robot. This app will show the feature of manual restock, where care taker or family person can add the medicines manually inside the app.

When the photo of medicine is taken and scanned, the app will scan the medicine and show the name of medicine. After that user can do manual restocking easily without getting confuse. This make the system more simple and reduce chances of wrong medicine entry.

The app will also provide low stock alert, when medicine quantity become low then user will get notification so that restocking can be done on proper time. The app will also store previous medicine name which patient is taking, so history can be seen anytime for reference.

Along with medicine features, the app will also show robot battery status, like how much battery robot have at that moment. If battery is going down, then alert will come so that robot can be charged and it will not stop suddenly.


Overall this mobile app is very helpful for medicine management, restocking process, patient medicine history and robot monitoring. This system is mainly useful for elderly people, chronic disease patient and differently abled persons, where regular medicine is very important
