 AiVa: The Next Generation (Round 2 Evolution)
For the next phase, we are moving beyond hardware to a Full-Stack Integrated Ecosystem. We are developing a dedicated mobile application designed to bridge the gap between the robot, the patient, and the caregiver.

1.  Intelligent Restocking with AI Vision
Smart Medication Scanning: To eliminate manual entry errors, the app features an AI-powered camera scanner. When a caregiver takes a photo of a medicine strip or bottle, the app automatically identifies the medication name and dosage.

Error-Free Manual Restock: By confirming the scanned data, caregivers can restock the robot’s inventory with a single tap, ensuring the digital log perfectly matches the physical supply.

2. Caregiver Monitoring & Compliance
Real-Time Inventory Tracking: The app maintains a live count of every pill. When supplies drop below a 3-day threshold, "Low Stock" push notifications are sent to the caregiver to prevent treatment interruptions.

Comprehensive Medication History: Every dose delivered by AiVa is logged. Caregivers can review historical data at any time to verify adherence or share reports with doctors during check-ups.

3.  System Health & Robotics Oversight
Live Battery Analytics: Users can monitor the robot's power levels in real-time. If the battery falls below 15%, a "Critical Power" alert is triggered, ensuring the robot is returned to its charging station before it shuts down.

Remote System Diagnostics: The app provides a "heartbeat" for the robot, confirming that sensors and motors are functioning correctly for the day's scheduled deliveries.

 Strategic Impact
This integrated app transforms AiVa into a fail-safe companion for elderly individuals, chronic disease patients, and differently-abled persons. By simplifying the restocking process and providing constant oversight, we significantly reduce the "caregiver burden" while maximizing patient safety.
