## Solutions

Our Solution "AiVa - Where Ai meets Human Care" is designed to help elderly people, patients with chronic diseases, and physically disabled individuals take their medicines on time. AiVa supports daily medication routines and helps reduce health risks caused by missed or incorrect doses.
At the scheduled time, AiVa triggers an alarm to alert the patient. The alert continues until the user responds, making sure the reminder is not ignored. This helps patients who often forget their medicine timings due to age, memory issues, or health conditions.
Once the patient responds, a smart wristband worn by the patient starts emitting signals. The robot detects these signals and follows the direction where the signal strength is highest. Using this method, the robot is able to move safely and accurately toward the patient’s location.
After reaching the patient, the robot delivers the medicine so the patient can take the correct dose at the right time. This reduces confusion about whether the medicine has already been taken or not and lowers the chances of missing or repeating a dose.
The solution is protected under Patent Number: 202511095020, showing its originality and innovation. In future updates (Round 2), the system will also update the medicine stock status in the mobile application to help caregivers manage refills on time.
