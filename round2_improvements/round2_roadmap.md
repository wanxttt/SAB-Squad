# AiVa: Strategic Roadmap for Round 2

To transform AiVa into a market-ready healthcare solution, we are shifting from a standalone hardware prototype to an **Integrated Digital Health Ecosystem**.

### 1. The AiVa Companion App
* **AI Vision Integration:** Using smartphone cameras to scan medicine labels and automatically populate the robot's delivery schedule.
* **Smart Restocking:** Caregivers can manage inventory remotely, receiving low-stock alerts before a patient runs out of critical medication.

### 2. Enhanced Hardware Reliability
* **Power Analytics:** The app will provide live battery health monitoring, ensuring the robot is always charged and ready for scheduled doses.
* **Patient History Logs:** A digital 'black box' that records every successful delivery for doctors to review during consultations.

###  Objective
Our goal for Round 2 is to reduce the "Caregiver Burden" by 50% through automated monitoring and fail-safe medication entry.
